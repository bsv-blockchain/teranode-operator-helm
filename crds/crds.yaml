                                            A node selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator
                                            that relates the key and values.

                              Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                              tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                              TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be

                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.

                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                              tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                                          pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can

                                          * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                          * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                            done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                            list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                            match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                            request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                            of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                            matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                          * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                            the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                            or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                          Implementations are required to support all path types.

                                              MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                              be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                              incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                              to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                              for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                              pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                              The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                              Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                        The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update.
                                        Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                        Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
                                        This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
                                        Defaults to 25%.
                                        Example: when this is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired pods
                                        immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet
                                        can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring
                                        that the total number of pods available at all times during the update is at
                                        least 70% of desired pods.

                                      Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                      Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                      tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                              be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the

                                              to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                              for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                              pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.

                                              Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                        Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.

                                            that relates the key and values.

                              Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                              If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                              Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                              Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                              tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                              to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.

                                          MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                          be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                          incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                          to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                          for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                          pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                          The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                          Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update.
                                Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
                                This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
                                Defaults to 25%.
                                Example: when this is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired pods
                                immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet
                                can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring
                                that the total number of pods available at all times during the update is at
                                least 70% of desired pods.

                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                              tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
